	/// The MultiChannelController is a GameComponent script, that enables you to play various sound effects or music clips 
	/// without the hassle of adding audio sources for them. 
	/// 
	/// You can derive from the MultiChannelController to add functionality or simple add it as a component and use it directly. 
	/// 
	/// To get started you have to initialize the controller by calling MultiChannelController::Init and provide the number of channels you want the controller to use. 
	/// Typically you create your controller with 3 or more channels. Once your controller is created, you can play any audio clip. 
	/// 
	/// There are two ways to play a clip. 
	/// 
	/// Continuous playback can be achieved by calling MultiChannelController::Play This will play the given audio clip on a free channel. 
	/// As a return value you get an instance of ChannelInfo. You can use this to stop the clip or to get the channel responsible for playing the clip. 
	/// 
	/// If what you want to do is play a simple effect, you should use MultiChannelController::PlaySoundEffect. This does not return any info and just plays the provided clip once on a free channel. 
	/// 
	/// A free channel is any channel not currently playing. If no channel is free, the controller will return the controller with the lowest volume. If there is still no channel found, the first channel will be used. 
	///
